# About Me

I am a first-year PhD student at [The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK)](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/english/index.html) under the supervision of Prof. [Qi Dou](https://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/~qdou/). Previously, I received my Bachelor degree from [Wuhan University](https://www.whu.edu.cn/) in 2022, advised by Prof. [Zhenzhong Chen](http://iip.whu.edu.cn/).

I am motivated by the open problems lying in machine learning and its application on computer vision and medical image analysis. My research interests spans algorithmic fairness, federated learning, generalizability, optimization, video understanding and enhancement, etc.
